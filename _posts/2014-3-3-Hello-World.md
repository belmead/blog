title: Mexican Trinitron

h/t to @bennieiv for directing me to an estate sale with a 27" Sony WEGA Trinitron ($5!). The scanline geometry is a bit ...wonky, but easy to ignore. I lack the knowledge, time, tools, and interest to do anything about it, and for $5, what's the difference? It could very well be the case this is how all flat-panel CRTs look. 

Edit: This is called bowing, and apparently Sony's Wega TVs are notorious for this effect (though all flat CRTs are susceptible). [CRT Database](https://crtdatabase.com/faq/adjusting-the-yoke-on-a-flat-crt-to-fix-bowing) has an excellent article on this. Yokes and that.
