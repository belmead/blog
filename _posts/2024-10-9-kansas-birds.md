title: Birds in Kansas

There's a walking trail on a for-sale plot of land contiguous to the corporate HQ where I work. I find it good and pleasing to walk this trail two or three times in the morning, depending on how warm it is.

The Lord's work is plainly evident on many mornings:

It's growing cooler in the morning, so different birds are returning and leaving. I saw this one today:

I reckon it's a Great Blue Heron based on the physical appearance:

- Long, slender legs 
- S-curved neck
- Long, pointed beak
- Overall grayish-blue coloration
- Large size (Great Blue Herons are one of the largest heron species in North America)

Finding it near a body of water in this part of the Midwest at this time of year is also in line with GBH behavior.

> Great Blue Herons are wading birds that hunt for fish, amphibians, and other small prey in shallow waters. They're known for their patient hunting style, often standing still or moving very slowly through the water before quickly striking at their prey. (claude.ai)

From our home's balcony in the suburbs, my wife took these pictures:

This is an Eastern Bluebird, the state bird of Kansas since 1927.

![A red bird](https://belmead.github.io/blog/images/missouri-red-bird-1.heic "A red bird")

A House Finch. Probably a male (bright red coloration). House Finches are small songbirds with the following characteristics:

- Reddish-pink coloration on the head, breast, and rump
- Brown streaking on the back and sides
- A stout, conical beak typical of seed-eating birds
- A slightly notched tail

This is not a bird.

This is Mammal, who lives in the pit? Dry retention pond? beyond our house. It's called Mammal because at the time we first saw him, neither my wife nor I knew what it was, so we settled on using the class name. We're now almost 100% positive Mammal is a woodchuck. They are also known as "whistlepigs." It has a funny run and eats flowers and grass.
